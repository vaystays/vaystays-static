* Work alongside full-stack developers to create reusable API endpoints
* Assist product and technical leads in project planning and driving technical direction
* Share, mentor, and foster an environment where you and others can grow and share technical knowledge

## Skills & Qualifications
* Experience building and using JavaScript libraries and modules utilized by the engineering team

* High attention to detail in maintaining design integrity throughout the Agile development lifecycle
* Experience using Git in a collaborative setting

* Experience writing object-oriented code, especially in JavaScript
* Strong knowledge of front-end web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
