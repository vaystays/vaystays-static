## We are property managers.

Our company started in 2006, with the purchase of one vacation rental home in South Bend, Indiana. Founders Chris and Geoff—both avid sports fans—had spent too many nights crashing on a friend’s couch and sleeping in their cars because they were unable to find, or afford, a hotel room on game day. That one house in South Bend was our solution.

But we weren’t done there. Soon, we’d purchased six homes, and a thriving rental-home marketplace followed soon after. To this day, [Gameday Housing](http://www.gamedayhousing.com/) provides high-end vacation rentals during big sports events—a necessary alternative to overpriced and overcrowded hotels.

## We’re also passionate about helping renters find the best vacation homes.

With the success of Gameday Housing came a realization: It’s difficult for consumers to find professionally managed rental homes. We launched [Vaystays](https://www.vaystays.com/) in 2014 with a single purpose: To bring professionalism and high standards back to the world of vacation rental homes.

Today, Vaystays lists more than 20,000 of the best vacation homes all over the world. More importantly, each comes with the peace of mind that only Vaystays can offer. We work with the world’s best property managers to ensure that every single property on our site is verified and professionally managed. So no matter where you’re going or what your budget is, there are no unpleasant surprises when you get there. Because ultimately, guaranteeing your dream vacation is our goal.
