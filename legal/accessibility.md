## Vaystays Accessibility Policy

Vaystays is committed to providing as accessible and usable a website as possible for our customers. Our goal is to make our website content available to the widest audience with the most diverse set of input methods. We are committed to including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in our product design process.

We recognize that WCAG, and the device landscape, continues to evolve and we are committed to evolving alongside it.

### Our Key Areas of Focus:

#### Documentation

We have  a wealth of information available to our engineering teams, including WCAG best practices, standards tools, and FAQs.

#### Quality Assurance

In our efforts to incorporate WCAG, Vaystays uses automated accessibility testing in conjunction with ongoing adherence to common-sense practices and W3C recommended defaults. We also attempt, at every point possible, to progressively enhance our web experiences while still providing a base experience to the widest amount of users.

#### Standardized User Experience

We strive to be first obvious, then standardized, then beautiful. Wherever possible, we build for web standards, and make components that promote understanding and allow for assumptions across our web experience.

#### Reusable and Compliant Components

In conjunction with our standardized user experience, we build components that can be used across our web properties that give us as much flexibility as needed, while confining us to web standards, and promoting uniformity across similar content elements types.
