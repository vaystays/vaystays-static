# TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE VACATION RENTAL PARTNERS LLC ("the Company" or "Vaystays") SERVICE
## Updated July 15, 2014

### 1. How this agreement works.
*1.1 Introduction.*
Welcome to Vaystays's online renting and listing community (the "Site"). This User Agreement ("Agreement") lists the terms of the agreement between you and Vacation Rental Partners LLC for the renting and listing of real estate property ("property"), and all other services that we provide (the "Services"). By completing the registration process, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to become a registered user of this Site.

*1.2 Modification.*
If we change this Agreement, we shall post a revised version of this Agreement here, which shall automatically replace the terms of this Agreement. Your continued use of the Site and the Services following Vaystays's posting of a revised Agreement will constitute your acceptance of the revised Agreement. If you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement or any revised version of this Agreement, do not continue to use the Services or this Site.

### 2. Who we are and what we do.
*2.1 Housing Rental Service Provider.*
Vaystays is a website service that allows registered users who want to rent Housing ("Renters") to find properties to rent from registered users who want to list their properties, including but not limited to property Owners, Owners' agents, etc. ("Owners"). Please remember that Vaystays acts as a marketplace only to allow Renters and Owners to interact regarding property rentals. .

### 3. How to become a registered user.
*3.1 Requirements.*
To be a registered user of this Site, you must agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and you must have a valid credit or debit card that we accept (see Section 5.2 below for further details). You may only use the Services if you are able to form legally binding contracts, are over the age of 18, and are not temporarily or indefinitely suspended from our Sites. If you do not qualify, please do not use or try to use the Services. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.

*3.2 Registration.*
We will not accept any request from you to rent or list a rental property before you have registered with us. To register, you must provide your legal and current name, address, phone number, an active email address, and (for guests only) a valid credit or debit card.

*3.3 Email Address and Password.*
You will need an email address and password to access the Site and use the Services. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your email address and password and for all activity that occurs under your email address and password. You should not disclose your password to any other person.

### 4. Listing rental properties as an Owner.
*4.1 Listing Process.*
A registered user who wants to list properties may list the properties in the Vaystays marketplace. As part of the listing process, the Owner assigns a rate to the property rental and provides information such as the event description, check-in date, check-out date, check-in time, check-out time, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of people property accommodates, and other amenities.

*4.2 Fixed Price Rentals.*
An Owner who lists a property (or properties) for rent on the site will do so using a fixed price rental. Under this system, the Owner sets a definite price at which the property will be reserved immediately when a Renter places a reservation request for the property.

*4.3 Owner Responsibility.*
Once an Owner confirms a reservation of a property from a Renter, the Owner is responsible for fulfilling the reservation with the exact property that the Owner listed. The Owner will be charged a convenience fee if Owner lists a property for rent and is unable to produce the exact property the Owner listed. The convenience fee will depend on how much it costs us to secure comparable or better replacement accommodations for the Renter. Vaystays is not responsible for any errors made by the Owner in the listing or pricing of a property rental and is not liable for any such errors.

### 5. Finding housing and securing reservations as a Renter.
*5.1 Making Reservations.*
To make a reservation, a Renter first browses the Vaystays listings for housing that match what the Renter is seeking. When the Renter finds desirable accommodations, the Renter places a "booking request" to reserve the housing. All booking requests are final and, once placed, cannot be cancelled or retracted. Placing a booking request does not complete the reservation. Owners have 72 hours to receive notification of an reservation and confirm delivery. The reservation is complete and Vaystays's Guarantee to the Renter takes effect only after the Owner has confirmed the reservation and the Renter's credit or debit card has been charged.

*5.2 Credit Card Authorization.*
The Renter's credit or debit card is not charged until the Renter's reservation is confirmed by the Owner. However, when a Renter places reservation request, we obtain an authorization from the Renter's credit or debit card for the full reservation amount. The authorization remains on the Renter's credit card until the transaction is completed or the reservation is cancelled. Although an authorization is not a charge, debit card issuers will place a hold on funds when an authorization is obtained by Vaystays. When booking housing, an authorization is sent to the Renter's credit or debit card for each reservation the Renter places.
Please contact your financial institution to better understand their policies on such matters. In all cases, Vaystays is not responsible for any bank fees or other penalties resulting from authorizations and/or charges to the Renter's credit or debit card when the Renter books a rental. Vaystays discourages the use of debit cards for reserving a rental.

*5.3 Property Listing Information.*
Event details, check-in date, check-out date, check-in time, check-out time, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of people property accommodates, and other amenities available may change. It is up to you, the Renter, to verify the most recent changes. Please contact the box office or refer to local listings for any changes.

*5.4 Owner Comments.*
Vaystays does not guarantee any information provided by Owners in the Owner Comments area of property listings.

### 6. Notifying the Owner of the reservation.
*6.1 Notification.*
Once we obtain an authorization from a Renter, we notify the Owner of the property via email and/or telephone that a Renter has reserved the listed property at the listed rate and is willing to pay the deposit that we have calculated for the rental. At this time, Vaystays verifies the authenticity of the reservation and reserves the right to cancel any reservation that it identifies as fraudulent.

*6.2 Owner's Confirmation.*
Once a home is listed as available in our system, it can be booked at any point by a guest. Once a home is booked, the Owner has confirmed that home as available for the dates promised. In the event the Owner wishes to terminate or cancel the rental at any point even prior to confirming the reservation, the Company reserves the right to charge the Owner a de-listing fee for any such cancellations and all other charges necessary to fulfill the renter's Vaystays Guarantee.

### 7. Completing the booking.
*7.1 Credit Card Charge.*
Once the Owner confirms the reservation, we charge the Renter's credit card for the total reservation rate. At no time do we provide the Renter's credit card information to the Owner. The credit card charge is paid to us, and the Owner is compensated for the reservation according to the payment policy. Owners can see the exact amount of the commission that we will collect before completing the listing process and committing to list their properties for rent.

*7.2 Dispute Resolution.*
After fulfilling a reservation, if a Renter is dissatisfied with any part of his or her experience, the Renter must follow the rules for dispute resolution set forth in our Guarantee.

### 8. Your relationship with us.
*8.1 Permission.*
As a Renter, you grant Vaystays permission to charge your credit card for your rental reservation. As a Owner, if you, at any time, fail to deliver the property you've listed or deliver invalid, fraudulent, counterfeit, or a misrepresented property rental you agree to be charged the costs to recover such damages incurred by a harmed Renter. These charges may include, but are not limited to, the cost of replacement housing, coupons and gift certificates, shipping charges, refunds to the Renter, and other charges we incur to satisfy the Renter under the terms of Vaystays's Renter's Guarantee.

*8.2 Grant of License.*
You grant Vaystays a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free right to exercise publicity, database, trademark and copyright rights, including the right to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and display on the Site and on the sites of our affiliated companies or classified services such as Craiglist, HomeAway, VRBO, or any similar site, any content you may provide to Vaystays in connection with your use of Vaystays and its Services. You agree that Vaystays shall be permitted to use your name or user ID, home city and other ancillary information (for example, the number of years you have been a Vaystays user) in connection with the content in conjunction with Vaystays's marketing, promotion and publicity efforts in any media known now or in the future; provided however that Vaystays shall not use your name or any of the above referenced material after your use of the Site ends without express written permission.

*8.3 Release.*
Vaystays acts as a marketplace only to allow Renters and Owners to interact regarding property rentals. In all cases, the submission and confirmation of reservations are transactions between Renters and Owners only. The fulfillment of confirmed reservations is the responsibility of the Owner. If you have a dispute with one or more registered users, you release Vaystays and all affiliated companies, officers, directors, agents, parents, subsidiaries, legal representatives and employees from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.
