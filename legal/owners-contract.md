## Vacation Rental Partners LLC (“Vaystays”) Owner Contract

THIS USER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made by and among Vacation Rental Partners LLC, an Indiana limited liability company ("the Company" or "Vaystays"), and Owner. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:

### 1. (Reserved)

### 2. Who we are and what we do.

*2.1 Housing Rental Service Provider.*
The Company owns www.Vaystays.com, a website service that allows registered users who want to rent Housing ("Guests") to find properties to rent from registered users who want to list their properties, including but not limited to property Owners, Owners' agents, etc. ("Owners"). Please remember that the Company acts as a marketplace only to allow Guests and Owners to interact regarding property rentals. The Company is merely an Agent and is not a party to any rental agreement between Guests and Owners.

### 3. How to become a registered user.

*3.1 Requirements.*
Requirements. To be a registered user of this Site, you must agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may only use the Services if you are able to form legally binding contracts, are over the age of 18, and are not temporarily or indefinitely suspended from our Sites. If you do not qualify, please do not use or try to use the Services. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.

*3.2 Registration.*
We will not accept any request from you to list a rental property before you have registered with us. To register, you must provide your legal and current name, address, phone number, and an active email address.

*3.3 Email Address and Password.*
You will need an email address and password to access the Site and use the Services. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your email address and password and for all activity that occurs under your email address and password. You should not disclose your password to any other person.

### 4. Listing rental properties as an Owner.

*4.1 Listing Process.*
A registered user who wants to list properties may list the properties in the the Company's marketplace. As part of the listing process, the Owner assigns a rate to the property rental and provides information including but not limited to property type, description of property, number of bedrooms and layouts, number of bathrooms, number of people the property accommodates, cancelation policy, dates available, check-in time, check-out time, and other amenities at the time the listing was created.

*4.2 Fixed Price Rentals.*
An Owner who lists a property (or properties) for rent on the site will do so using a fixed price rental. Under this system, the Owner sets a definite price at which the property will be reserved immediately when a Guest places a reservation request for the property

*4.3 Owner Responsibility.*
Once an Owner lists a property and a reservation of a property from a Guest is confirmed from our system, the Owner is responsible for fulfilling the reservation with the exact property that the Owner listed. The Owner may be charged a convenience fee if Owner lists a property for rent and is unable to produce the exact property the Owner listed. The convenience fee will depend on how much it costs us to secure comparable or better replacement accommodations for the Guest pursuant to our Guest guarantee. The Company is not responsible for any errors made by the Owner in the listing or pricing of a property rental and is not liable for any such errors.

*4.4 Payments.*
The Company shall hold all rental payments in escrow for Owners until 48 hours after the scheduled guest check-in period and until all disputes have been properly resolved with any Guests pursuant to Section 4.7 below. The Company shall be entitled to a 8.5% commission on all rental sums. In the event of a Guest cancellation, the Company shall be entitled to a full commission and the Owner shall receive any excess amount forfeited by the canceling Guest. To be clear, unless otherwise noted all Guests pay in full in advance and Guest cancellations in no way affect the net amount paid to Owner unless special payment arrangements have been made and confirmed with Owner.

In the event you have signed up with the Company through a property management software company such as Escapia or ISI, the Company will pay you for any rentals booked in accordance with the terms and conditions of those property management software companies.

*4.5 Security Deposits and Insurance.*
The Company shall hold a security deposit from all Guests to protect Owners against damages to the properties. The Company shall work with the Owner to assure that the security deposit requested from Guest is approved by Owner. To the extent any damages to the rental property exceed the security deposit, the Company shall not be liable and the Owner hereby agrees to hold the Company harmless from any such damages. In the event Guests and Owner cannot reach an agreement as to any disputed damage amount, such amount shall be determined by the Company in their sole discretion. The Company shall not be responsible for obtaining insurance policies on the properties of any owners. The Company encourages the Owner to obtain a Landlord's Insurance Policy on any property to be listed on the Site.

*4.6 Term.*
This agreement shall be in effect as of the date first written above, and shall automatically renew annually on December 1 unless the Company or the Owner express in writing 10 days prior to December 1 of the current year their desire to terminate such agreement.

*4.7 Mediation.*
The Company shall work with the Owner and Guest to resolve any disputes as to the security deposit following any rental. In the event that the Company is unable to adequately resolve any conflicts between the parties to their mutual satisfaction, the Company shall use their discretion to refund and/or capture all disputed security deposits amounts and shall provide the parties with each other's legal contact information for any court purposes. Owner hereby agrees that the Company is not a party to any contract and is merely acting as the agent for the Owner, and hereby agrees to hold the Company harmless in any such legal actions related to security deposit dispute mediations.

### 5. Notifying the Owner of the reservation.

*5.1 Notification.*
Once we obtain an authorization from a Guest, we notify the Owner of the property via email and/or telephone that a Guest has reserved the listed property at the listed rate. At this time, the Company verifies the authenticity of the reservation and reserves the right to cancel any reservation that it identifies as fraudulent.

*5.2 Owner's Confirmation.*
Once a home is listed as available in our system, it can be booked at any point by a guest. Once a home is booked, the Owner has confirmed that home as available for the dates promised. In the event the Owner wishes to terminate or cancel the rental at any point after the reservation is confirmed, the Company reserves the right to charge the Owner a de-listing fee for any such cancellations and all other charges necessary to fulfill the Guest's Guarantee.

### 6. (Reserved)

### 7. Your relationship with us.

*7.1 Cancellations.*
As an Owner, you grant the Company permission to charge you if you, at any time, fail to deliver the property you've listed & rented or deliver invalid, fraudulent, counterfeit, or a misrepresented property rental.
