## Our mission.

When booking and traveling, we value the professionalism and convenience of fine hotel brands, but much prefer to stay in vacation homes. When it comes to standardization, however, the vacation home rental industry we know and love tends to pale in comparison to the hotel industry we admire and trust.

Vaystays was founded with one mission: To bridge this industry gap.

## Our dedication to your vacation.

We believe hotels are for work and homes are for vacation. We know that families, groups of friends, and travelers would choose a home instead of a hotel for their extended trip the vast majority of the time. We are committed to making every stay in a vacation home run as smoothly as a stay in the finest hotel.

## Our strategic partners.

The interests of the traveler come first. We all succeed when travelers have a great experience before, during, and after their stay. Our suppliers agree with this wholeheartedly. That’s why they’re the key to our success—we offer them best-in-class technology solutions, making it easy for them to simply run their business. And they, in turn, are empowered to give you the best service possible.

## Our values.

### Integrity.

Trust, honesty, and integrity are at the heart of our business. We expect our team to act with integrity and operate with high ethical standards in everything they do.

### Professionalism.

Customer service is at our core, and we treat every person and conversation with the same high degree of respect.

### Relationships.

The foundation of any great business is its relationships. That’s why we treat our customers and suppliers alike as though they were family.

### Teamwork.

Our team’s dedication to our mission—as well as our intense effort—are greater than the sum of our parts. We always work together to push our company in the best direction—not along the path of least resistance.

### Quality.

We take great pride in the professional quality of our work. We would always rather be best at what we do than be biggest, though we aspire to both.

### Inventiveness.

We strive to provide superior technology and user experiences for both our suppliers and renters. These solutions give both property owners and renters some much-needed peace of mind as they book or run their businesses.
